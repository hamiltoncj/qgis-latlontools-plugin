This takes a point vector layer and creates a new layer with the layer's latitude, longitude (Y, X) coordinates copied into one or two fields in the new output layer. The user has a lot of flexibility as to the output format. For Wgs84 the output can be in decimal degrees or DMS. Other formats include GeoJSON, WKT, MGRS, Standard UTM, UPS, Geohash, Plus Codes, GEOREF, and Maidenhead grid.
